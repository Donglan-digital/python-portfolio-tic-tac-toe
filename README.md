# Python_Day 83 Assignment: Portfolio Website
This project is the assignment for Day 84 of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

##### **Day 84 Assignment: **Tic Tac Toe****

Build a text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game.

##### **Instructions:**

Using what you have learnt about Python programming, you will build a text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game. The game should be playable in the command line just like the Blackjack game we created on Day 11. It should be a 2-player game, where one person is "X" and the other plays "O".



This is a simple demonstration of how the game works:

You can choose how you want your game to look. The simplest is to create a game board using "|" and "_" symbols. But the design is up to you.

If you have more time, you can challenge yourself to build an AI player to play the game with you.

#### Questions for this assignment

Reflection Time:

This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.

Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

My answer:

The most difficult part of this assignment is to check the winner by rows, columns and diagonals. It involves using mathematical logic and using python list and index to get hold of values.
